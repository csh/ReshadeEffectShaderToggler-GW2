# ReshadeEffectShaderToggler-GW2

These are just my personal settings for [ReshadeEffectToggler] for applying shaders without affecting the game's UI.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

_Using addons of any kind for Guild Wars 2 is done so at your own risk and not officially supported._

## Installation

_This assumes you have already installed **ReShade with addon support** as well as **[ReshadeEffectToggler]**._

1. Download the [ReshadeEffectToggler.ini](https://github.com/csh/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler-GW2/blob/main/ReshadeEffectToggler.ini) file (CTRL-Shift-S after clicking the link)
2. Place the INI file next to `ReshadeEffectShaderToggler.addon64`

3. Launch the game, your shaders should work without affecting the UI.
4. You can confirm the settings have loaded correctly

Your file path may be slightly different based on how your reshade installation is setup.
